Some particle physics projects for personal reference.

Visit the site http://ppsnippets.tk

##The site uses:
* Jekyll, hosted on GitHub. Social/repo, file excluding, liquid links, permalinks and user variable `menuname`
* Fonts [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) and [Bree Serif](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Bree+Serif)
* No preprocessors
* Responsive menu using just CSS
* HTML entities for greek letters
* Prefix-free for clean CSS
* [Prism](http://prismjs.com/) syntax hightlighter with markup and C++ (if `prism: true`)
* [mathjax](www.mathjax.org) and [MathML](http://www.w3.org/Math/) (if `mathjax: true`)
* Front image by [http://www.freepik.com](http://www.freepik.com)


##TO DO

- [ ] Load MathJax only if the browser does not support it (and hope the browser doesn't lie)
- [ ] With MathML, the size of the numerator and denominator in fractions can be increased with CSS, in MathJax no, so they look very small :worried:
- [ ] Check that the site is accesible
