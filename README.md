# Particle Physics snippets

These are some particle physics snippets of code for personal reference.
For proper explanation check [the pages](http://ppsnippets.tk).

## DOSIMETRY

Simulation of a particle entering a material. A C++ calculation of the stopping power of any material (and air). It also calculates the range of the particle.

## PI

An approximation of PI with random numbers.

## HER simulation

A High Energy Ring was designed with [**Win-AGILE**](https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e00/PAPERS/TUP6B03.pdf), a tool created by P. J. Bryant for the simulation of simple lattices.

See description of the snippets in the dedicated webpage: http://ppsnippets.tk.
